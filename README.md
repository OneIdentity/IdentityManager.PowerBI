## Power BI Custom Connector for One Identity Manager
This is a simple Power BI Custom Connector for [One Identity' Identity Manager](https://www.oneidentity.com/products/identity-manager/)
The Power BI connector for One Identity Manager is built for replacing the requirement of direct SQL access to a One Identity Manager database. Instead the ReST API of the Application Server is used for connecting to a One Identity Manager. The benefits are
  - using https as a protocol instead of SQL
  - by requiring a One Identity Manager authentication the permissions layer in One Identity Manager ensuring that users only get information they are supposed to see.

Once the custom connector reaches it stable status, One Identity will be seeking certification by Microsoft.
